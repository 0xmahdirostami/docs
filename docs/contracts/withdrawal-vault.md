# WithdrawalVault

- [Source Code](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/master/contracts/0.8.9/WithdrawalVault.sol)
- [Deployed Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb9d7934878b5fb9610b3fe8a5e441e8fad7e293f)

A vault that corresponds to the type-0x01 Lido withdrawal credentials.
The currently deployed version is upgradable because of anticipated changes in Ethereum withdrawals mechanics.

:::note
The contract is meant to be ossified somewhere after withdrawal credentials triggerable exits are implemented.
