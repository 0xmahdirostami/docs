# Lido

- [Source code](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/master/contracts/0.4.24/Lido.sol)
- [Deployed contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84)

Lido is the core contract which acts as a liquid staking pool. The contract is responsible for Ether deposits and withdrawals, minting and burning liquid tokens, delegating funds to node operators, applying fees, and accepting updates from the oracle contract. Node Operators' logic is extracted to a separate contract, NodeOperatorsRegistry.

Lido also acts as an ERC20 token which represents staked ether, stETH. Tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH tokens are pegged 1:1 to the Ethers that are held by Lido. stETH tokenâ€™s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day.

## Rebasing

When a rebase occurs the supply of the token is increased or decreased algorithmically, based on the staking rewards(or slashing penalties) in the Eth2 chain. Rebase happens when oracles report beacon stats.

Rebasing mechanism implemented via "shares". Instead of storing map with account balances, Lido stores which share owned by account in the total amount of Ether controlled by the protocol.

Balance of account calculated next way:

```
balanceOf(account) = shares[account] * totalPooledEther / totalShares
```

- `shares` - map of user account balances

- `totalPooledEther` is a sum of three types of ether owned by protocol:

  - bufferedBalance - deposit which stored on contract and not deposited to official Deposit contract
  - beaconBalance - total amount of ether on validator accounts
  - transientBalance - submitted to the official Deposit contract but not yet visible in the beacon state.

- `totalShares` sum of all shares in `shares` map

For example, assume that we have:

```
totalShares = 500
totalPooledEther = 10 ETH
sharesOf(Alice) -> 100
sharesOf(Bob) -> 400
```

Therefore:

```
balanceOf(Alice) -> 2 tokens which corresponds 2 ETH
balanceOf(Bob) -> 8 tokens which corresponds 8 ETH
```

## Oracles Reporting

Report happens once at a frame. Frame duration can be set by DAO, current value is 24 hours.
To push report to Lido contract Oracle demands quorum (necessary amount of reports with equal stats from oracle demons wasn't collected) to be reached.
If quorum wasn't reached next report can happen only at the first epoch of next frame (after 24 hours).

Report consists of count of validators participated in protocol - beacon validators and total amount of ether on validator accounts - beacon balance. Typically beacon balance growth from report to report, but in exceptional cases it also can go down, because of slashing.

- When beacon balance grown between reports, protocol register profit and distribute reward between stETH holders, node operators, insurance fund and treasury.
- When frame was ended with slashing and new beacon balance less than previous one total supply of stETH becomes less than in previous report and no rewards distributed.
