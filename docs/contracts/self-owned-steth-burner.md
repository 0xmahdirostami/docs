# SelfOwnedStETHBurner

- [Source Code](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/develop/contracts/0.8.9/SelfOwnedStETHBurner.sol)
- [Deployed Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbaadf00d)

The contract provides a way for Lido governance to burn stETH token shares as a means to distributed cover
for losses to staking.

It relies on the [rebasing](contracts/lido#rebasing) nature of the stETH. The basic account balance calculation
defined by the `Lido` contract with the following formula:
`balanceOf(account) = shares[account] * totalPooledEther / totalShares`.
Therefore, burning someone's shares (e.g. decreasing the `totalShares` amount) leads to increasing
all of the other accounts' balances.

The contract doesnâ€™t implement any auto-cover mechanism. There are no presumption and prerequisites of
when and how exactly loss compensation happens. `SelfOwnedStETHBurner` provides a safe and deterministic way
to incur positive stETH token rebase by gradually decreasing `totalShares` that could be correctly handled
by 3rd party protocols (e.g. Anchor Protocol) integrated with stETH.

`SelfOwnedStETHBurner` accepts burning requests by locking caller-provided stETH tokens. Those burning requests
are initially set by the contract to a pending state. Actual burning happens as part of an oracle (LidoOracle)
beacon report to prevent additional fluctuations of the existing stETH token rebase period (~24h).

We also distinguish two types of shares burn requests:
* request to **cover** slashing event (e.g. decreasing of the total pooled ETH amount
between the two consecutive oracle reports);
* request to burn shares for any other cases (**non-cover**).

The contract has two separate counters for the burnt shares: cover and non-cover ones. The contract have
exclusive access to the stETH shares burning via constrained [`BURN_ROLE`](token-guides/seth-superuser-functions):
burning allowed only from the contract's own balance only.

To prevent too large rebasing events encouraging unfair coverage distribution via front-running techniques,
the contract has a limit of shares to burn per single beacon report. Thus, burning requests
could be executed in more than one pass.

The full formal spec provided with
[LIP-6](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-6.md).

## Shares burnt counters

The contract stores the total amount of shares ever burnt, distinguishing cover and non-cover shares,
by maintaining two separate counters inside: `totalCoverSharesBurnt` and `totalNonCoverSharesBurnt`.
The counters are increased when actual stETH burn is performed as part of the Lido Oracle report.

This allows to split any stETH rebase into two sub-components: the rewards-induced rebase
and cover application-induced rebase, which can be done as follows:

1. Before the rebase, store the previous values of both counters, as well as the value of stETH share price:
   ```sol
   prevCoverSharesBurnt = SelfOwnedStETHBurner.totalCoverSharesBurnt()
   prevSharePrice = stETH.totalSupply() / stETH.getTotalShares()
   ```
2. After the rebase, perform the following calculations:
   ```sol
   sharesBurntFromOldToNew = SelfOwnedStETHBurner.totalCoverSharesBurnt() - prevCoverSharesBurnt;
   newSharePriceAfterCov = stETH.totalSupply() / (stETH.getTotalShares() + sharesBurntFromOldToNew);
   newSharePrice = stETH.totalSupply() / stETH.getTotalShares();

   // rewards-induced share price increase
   rewardPerShare = newSharePriceAfterCov - prevSharePrice;

   // cover-induced share price increase
   nonRewardSharePriceIncrease = newSharePrice - prevSharePrice - rewardPerShare;
   ```

The Anchor Protocol integration (bETH token) already has the calculations proposed above implemented using a plug-in
adapter [`InsuranceConnector`](https://github.com/lidofinance/anchor-collateral-steth/blob/feature/lip-6/contracts/InsuranceConnector.vy)
for retrieving the total number of shares burnt for cover purposes.
See [`AnchorVault.collect_rewards#442`](https://github.com/lidofinance/anchor-collateral-steth/blob/e0e23e63ad24d44c2ffc0799cc701dbe71a578ed/contracts/AnchorVault.vy#L442)
for the possible sketch of usage with similar integrations.

## Methods

### Function: requestBurnMyStETHForCover

Transfers stETH tokens from the message sender and irreversibly locks these on the burner contract address.
Internally converts tokens amount into underlying shares amount and marks the converted shares amount
for cover-backed burning by increasing the internal `coverSharesBurnRequested` counter.

```sol
function requestBurnMyStETHForCover(uint256 _stETH2Burn) external
```

:::note
Reverts if any of the following is true:
* `msg.sender` is not equal to the set upon construction `voting` address;
* no stETH provided (`_stETH2Burn == 0`);
* no stETH transferred (allowance exceeded).

| ------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `_stETH2Burn` | `uint256` | stETH tokens amount (not shares amount) to burn |

### Function: requestBurnMyStETH

Transfers stETH tokens from the message sender and irreversibly locks these on the burner contract address.
Internally converts tokens amount into underlying shares amount and marks the converted amount for
non-cover-backed burning by increasing the internal `nonCoverSharesBurnRequested` counter.

:::note
Reverts if any of the following is true:
* `msg.sender` is not equal to the set upon construction `voting` address;
* no stETH provided (`_stETH2Burn == 0`);
* no stETH transferred (allowance exceeded).

Expressed in basis points as ratio of shares to burn to the total shares in existence.

```sol
function setBurnAmountPerRunQuota(uint256 _maxBurnAmountPerRunBasisPoints) external
```

:::note
Reverts if any of the following is true:
* `_maxBurnAmountPerRunBasisPoints` is zero;
* `_maxBurnAmountPerRunBasisPoints` exceeds `10000`;
* `msg.sender` is not equal to the set upon construction `voting` address;
:::

#### Parameters:

| Name                              | Type      | Description           |

### Function: processLidoOracleReport

Enacts cover/non-cover burning requests and logs cover/non-cover shares amount just burnt.
Increments public `totalCoverSharesBurnt` and `totalNonCoverSharesBurnt` counters.
Decrements internal `coverSharesBurnRequested` and `nonCoverSharesBurnRequested` counters.

Does nothing if there are no pending burning requests.
Could be called as part of an oracle quorum report only.

```sol
function: processLidoOracleReport(uint256, uint256, uint256) external override
```

:::note
The burning requests could be executed partially per single run due to the `maxBurnAmountPerRunBasisPoints` limit.
The cover reasoned burning requests have a higher priority of execution.

Reverts if there are pending burning requests and the `msg.sender` is not of one
of the `LidoOracle` or `LidoOracle.getBeaconReportReceiver()`.

Input parameters are needed only for the ABI compatibility, the values are always ignored.

on the contract's balance.

```sol
function recoverExcessStETH() external
```
