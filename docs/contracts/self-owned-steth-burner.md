# SelfOwnedStETHBurner

- [Source Code](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/develop/contracts/0.8.9/SelfOwnedStETHBurner.sol)
- [Deployed Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB280E33812c0B09353180e92e27b8AD399B07f26)

The contract provides a way for Lido governance to burn stETH token shares as a means to cover losses in staking.

It relies on the [rebasing](/contracts/lido#rebasing) nature of stETH. The `Lido` contract calculates user balance using the following equation,
`balanceOf(account) = shares[account] * totalPooledEther / totalShares`.
Therefore, burning shares (e.g. decreasing the `totalShares` amount) increases stETH holders' balances.

The contract doesnâ€™t implement any auto-cover mechanism. There are no presumptions and prerequisites for
when and how exactly loss compensation happens. `SelfOwnedStETHBurner` provides a safe and deterministic way
to incur a positive stETH token rebase by gradually decreasing `totalShares` that can be correctly handled
by 3rd party protocols (e.g. Anchor Protocol) integrated with stETH.

`SelfOwnedStETHBurner` accepts burning requests by locking caller-provided stETH tokens. Those burn requests
are initially set by the contract to a pending state. Actual burning happens as part of an oracle (LidoOracle)
beacon report to prevent additional fluctuations of the existing stETH token rebase period (~24h).

We also distinguish two types of shares burn requests:
* request to **cover** a slashing event (e.g. decreasing of the total pooled ETH amount
between the two consecutive oracle reports);
* request to burn shares for any other cases (**non-cover**).

The contract has two separate counters for the burnt shares: cover and non-cover ones. The contract has
exclusive access to the stETH shares burning via constrained [`BURN_ROLE`](/token-guides/steth-superuser-functions#superuser-roles):
burning allowed only from the contract's own balance only.

To prevent overly large rebasing events entailing unfair coverage distribution via front-running techniques,
the contract has a limit on burnable shares per single beacon report. Thus, burning requests
can be executed in more than one pass.

The full formal spec is provided with
[LIP-6](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-6.md).

## Cover application workflow

1. The contract accepts burn requests only from the `Aragon Voting` contract by transferring stETH.
2. The transfer is performed by `requestBurnMyStETHForCover` func call which requires explicit `approve` beforehand.
3. Cover application is performed as a part of oracle reports and rate-limited to prevent sandwiching.

NB: daily burn quota is set to 4BP of TVL, consider to tune it if needed (overall token rebase should stay less than 7.5BP).

## Shares burnt counters

The contract keeps count of all shares ever burned by way of maintaining two internal counters: `totalCoverSharesBurnt` and `totalNonCoverSharesBurnt` for cover and non-cover burns respectively. These counters are increased when actual stETH burn is performed as part of the Lido Oracle report.

This makes it possible to split any stETH rebase into two sub-components: the rewards-induced rebase
and cover application-induced rebase, which can be done as follows:

1. Before the rebase, store the previous values of both counters, as well as the value of stETH share price:
   ```sol
   prevCoverSharesBurnt = SelfOwnedStETHBurner.totalCoverSharesBurnt()
   prevSharePrice = stETH.totalSupply() / stETH.getTotalShares()
   ```
2. After the rebase, perform the following calculations:
   ```sol
   sharesBurntFromOldToNew = SelfOwnedStETHBurner.totalCoverSharesBurnt() - prevCoverSharesBurnt;
   newSharePriceAfterCov = stETH.totalSupply() / (stETH.getTotalShares() + sharesBurntFromOldToNew);
   newSharePrice = stETH.totalSupply() / stETH.getTotalShares();

   // rewards-induced share price increase
   rewardPerShare = newSharePriceAfterCov - prevSharePrice;

   // cover-induced share price increase
   nonRewardSharePriceIncrease = newSharePrice - prevSharePrice - rewardPerShare;
   ```

The Anchor Protocol integration (bETH token) already has the calculations proposed above implemented using a plug-in
adapter [`InsuranceConnector`](https://github.com/lidofinance/anchor-collateral-steth/blob/feature/lip-6/contracts/InsuranceConnector.vy)
for retrieving the total number of shares burnt for cover purposes.
See [`AnchorVault.collect_rewards#442`](https://github.com/lidofinance/anchor-collateral-steth/blob/e0e23e63ad24d44c2ffc0799cc701dbe71a578ed/contracts/AnchorVault.vy#L442)
for the possible sketch of usage with similar integrations.

## Methods

### Function: requestBurnMyStETHForCover

Transfers stETH tokens from the message sender and irreversibly locks these on the burner contract address.
Internally converts tokens amount into underlying shares amount and marks the converted shares amount
for cover-backed burning by increasing the internal `coverSharesBurnRequested` counter.

```sol
function requestBurnMyStETHForCover(uint256 _stETH2Burn) external
```

### Function: requestBurnMyStETH

Transfers stETH tokens from the message sender and irreversibly locks these on the burner contract address.
Internally converts tokens amount into underlying shares amount and marks the converted amount for
non-cover-backed burning by increasing the internal `nonCoverSharesBurnRequested` counter.

### Function: processLidoOracleReport

Enacts cover/non-cover burning requests and logs cover/non-cover shares amount just burnt.
Increments public `totalCoverSharesBurnt` and `totalNonCoverSharesBurnt` counters.
Decrements internal `coverSharesBurnRequested` and `nonCoverSharesBurnRequested` counters.

Does nothing if there are no pending burning requests.
Could be called as part of an oracle quorum report only.

```sol
function: processLidoOracleReport(uint256, uint256, uint256) external override
```

:::note
The burning requests could be executed partially per single run due to the `maxBurnAmountPerRunBasisPoints` limit.
The cover reasoned burning requests have a higher priority of execution.

Reverts if there are pending burning requests and the `msg.sender` is not of one
of the `LidoOracle` or `LidoOracle.getBeaconReportReceiver()`.

Input parameters are needed only for the ABI compatibility, the values are always ignored.

on the contract's balance.
